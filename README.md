## Room for Improvement
Improvements to be Done :
- Work on data visualisation techniques and how to improve the appearance and design to enhance its appeal.
- Ensure to use a practical data set that enables the use of bar graphs, histograms, and other forms of data visualisation.

To Do :
- Add more information (text) to the dashboard and provide more context to help users understand what it is for.
- Along with graphs and charts, add more colour to ensure the dashboard is more appealing, interactive, and easy to comprehend.
